## About Me

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [COEUS lab](https://astrolavos.gatech.edu/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://https://ece.gatech.edu/), where I am 
fortunate enough to be advised by [Fabian Monrose](https://fabianmonrose.github.io/). My research aims to help organizations 
with limited cybersecurity resources better protect their 
digital assets. My current work tackles this problem from the 
perspective of domain name abuse.

Before joining Georgia Tech, I held a couple of research 
assistantship positions. Respectively in 2021 and 2022, I worked under the 
supervision of [Assane Gueye](https://www.cmu.edu/epp/cee-tp/assane-gueye.html) at [Cylab-Africa](https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/research/cybersecurity/cylab/index.html) in Rwanda, and [Tegawendé F. Bissyandé](https://bissyande.github.io/) in the [TruX group](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/research-groups/TruX/) in Luxembourg. I owe my preparation for those opportunities to my 
education at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu) for 
my Master of Science in 2021 and at the ["Institut de Formation et de Recherche 
en Informatique"](https://ifri-uac.bj/) for my Bachelor of Science in 2018.
