## About Me

I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering 
at Georgia Tech. My research aims to provide recommendations for companies to 
efficiently protect their digital assets. In the end, I expect this to be used
by SMEs that cannot afford the services of overpriced security companies. I am
co-advised by Prof. Fabian Monrose and Manos Antonakakis.

I received my Bachelor in Computer Science (concentration IT Security) from the
Institut de Formation et de Recherche en Information (IFRI) at the University of
Abomey-Calavi and a master's degree in Information Technology (concentrations in Machine Learning and Cybersecurity) from Carnegie Mellon University.
