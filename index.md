## About Me

<div style='text-align: justify;'>I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [COEUS lab](https://astrolavos.gatech.edu/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://https://ece.gatech.edu/), where I am 
fortunate enough to be advised by [Fabian Monrose](https://fabianmonrose.github.io/) and [Manos 
Antonakakis](https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/manos-antonakakis). My research aims to help organizations 
with limited cyber-security resources better protect their 
digital assets. My current work tackles this problem from the 
perspective of domain name abuse.</div>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>Before joining Georgia Tech, I held a couple of research 
assistantship positions. In 2021 and 2022, I worked under the 
supervision of [Tegawendé F. Bissyandé](https://bissyande.github.io/) in the [TruX group](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/research-groups/TruX/) and [Assane Gueye](https://www.cmu.edu/epp/cee-tp/assane-gueye.html) at [Cylab-Africa](https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/research/cybersecurity/cylab/index.html). I owe my preparation for those opportunities to my 
education at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu) for 
my M.S. (2021) and the ["Institut de Formation et de Recherche 
en Informatique"](https://ifri-uac.bj/) for my bachelor's (2019).</div>
